# Clentra
A lightweight open source libre book keeping software; completely offline, localised and secure.

Clentra - Bookkeeping Software
Name creation based on jumbling words - Clay (for clay scripts), entry (for data entry), extra (cos ill add extra features beyond simple bookkeeping?)
- Localised, offline (atleast the core components), free (open-source), secure, lightweight

Target Audience (would have to be a niche crowd):
- small businesses/freelancers | because they may want simple bookkeeping with no SaaS fees
- rural users | because they may have unreliable internet access, rendering cloud apps to be an issue
- private people | because they may not want big corporations or just strangers to handle and see their data
- developing regions | may not have access to certain requirements for cloud use like credit cards etc?
- hobbiysts | may just want to track their personal spending in a simple fashion, not running a business

Pros of an offline app:
- localised data (no syncing, no cloud)
- great for privacy buffs
- limited backup (unless I add it?)
- no server/backend required 
- similar tech stacks as previous project (vaultic)

Cons of an offline app:
- can't sync across devices due to no cloud access
- greater accessibility and convenience
- auto-backup is not easily achieved
- won't include a client/server architecture (most impressive architecture showcase)
- less modern and competitive
- won't be able to utilise apis and web stacks (more rigidity)
